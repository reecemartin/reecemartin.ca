# reecemartin.github.io

A personal website for my use.

# What is the site?

The purpose of this site is to provide a resume/portfolio like presentation of my skills and achievements, largely for purposes of sharing. However this site is also a place for me to try deploying and testing some frontend and web technologies 
for personal practice. 

I also feature some small demo features one of which is based on work in another one of my Github repositories.
